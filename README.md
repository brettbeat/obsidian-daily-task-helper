# Daily Note Task Helper

This plugin automatically moves unchecked tasks from the previous daily note into today's daily note.

Usage: In the settings, you must specify the name of the folder your daily notes are kept in. Additionally, if you are using a daily note template, you can specify a section you'd like the tasks to be placed under (e.g. '## To Do' will put the tasks under the h2 styled To Do section). Otherwise, the tasks will be inserted at the top of the file.
